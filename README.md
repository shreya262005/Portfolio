# Portfolio
Portfolio Website
Built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this portfolio demonstrates my understanding of core web technologies.
It’s hosted on GitHub and structured for easy collaboration, showcasing clean code and best practices.
Projects include both frontend and backend builds, with links to source code and live demos.
Responsive design, modular components, and semantic HTML are central to this portfolio’s architecture.
This space is more than just a portfolio — it's my digital canvas to express ideas through code and design.
Every animation, interaction, and color choice tells part of my story as a developer and creator.
I built this portfolio to not just show my work, but to feel like my work.
Behind every section is a combination of imagination, learning, and countless cups of coffee.
